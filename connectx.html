                        <h2>ConnectX Cultivates Personal Relationships</h2>
                        <p>With the ConnectX platform relationships start as a personal one. 
                        Whether you are looking for the perfect canidate for the job, 
                        or you are looking for the perfect place to workthat will fit your personality and values, 
                        ConnectX will ensure each interaction is a personal interaction.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div id="howitworks">
                        <h2>How It Works</h2>
                        <p>Each ConnectX user has a personal business profile that will display various information about that canidate (or business).
                        ConnectX strives to have a familiar "Social Netowrk" feel for each user. User profiles will display information such as 
                        work history, skillsets and strengths, and what each canidate is looking for in their next opportunity. What sets ConnectX
                        apart from other platforms is the use of video to show of your personality and character. We wanted to take away the impersonal
                        aspects of names on paper and allow each user to have their moment to shine in a video on their profile stating who they are,
                        what they stand for, and why a company should higher them based of <strong>who they are as a person</strong> and not just their resume.
                        The users are able to tag their profile with career fields to easily be searched by businesses or even connect with other people with
                        related tags. Business Users have the same features available to them as they can an organization profile that can link back to personal
                        user profiles for their employees. The organization can show videos on what it is like to work for them and what their company values are,
                        as well as have recruiters that can send videos to canidates talking about their skills and what they thought about their own personal
                        profile videos. ConnectX aims to cultivates the personal interaction from the moment each party interacts, to the handshake in the office
                        that welcomes someone to the team.</p>
